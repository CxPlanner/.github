# What is CxPlanner

CxPlanner was started by [Thomas T. Jarl√∏v](https://ttj.dk) because he needed a
software solution to manage multiple projects at the same time. And now it is an
international software solution used by many clients to manage and monitor their
projects.

Since the creation of CxPlanner, the scope and goal has developed - CxPlanner
wants to digitalize and optimize the construction industry. We can and will do
that by integrating the processes from the Commissioning Process into the rest
of the construction industry.

CxPlanner's core is a project and task management system with all needed tools
such as user management and more, but we do also have multiple special plugins.
As one of the only software solutions we are in 100% compliance with commissioning
standards such as ASHRAE Guideline 0 and ASHRAE Standard 202 as well as the Danish
Standard DS3090.
Besides that we do comply with all documentation requirements within the industry.

The first practical book for the commissioning process (a quality orientated
process for construction process) actually includes many screenshots and
examples from CxPlanner. See more at [A Practical Guide to the Commissioning Process](https://cxguideline.com)
and [Guide til commissioning i praksis](https://cxguide.dk).


# Code base

The main code is closed source and developed internally in CxPlanner. But we do
support open source, and we have developed many open source projects and
libraries, which we also use in CxPlanner. In that way we ensure updates
and stability for these.

Most of our open source projects are currently located at
[ThomasTJdev](https://github.com/ThomasTJdev), but will be moved to our
organizational repo in the future.

We are all happy [Nim-lang](https://nim-lang.org/) coders, and we would like
to encourage any new or experienced programmer to take Nim for run. Fast,
Efficient, Python like syntax, Elegant, C-speed, and much more.


# Locations

Our main location is Denmark, but our software is available at Danish, English,
German, Spanish and Dutch. We do have supporters and sellers in those locations,
so just send us an email at support@cxplanner.com for more information.
